## Issues
**1.** Create an issue with suggestions for what to change, or do so yourself.
Within the scope of what the app is, features will be added in the next release following friendly discussion.

**2.** Help is needed anywhere you see fit, please do.

## Code reviews
**3.** The code for the beta channel, and possibly implementation of features is in need of review.
Fork the repo and build the code from the `develop` branch to see its progress. If something is broken, write about it in an issue.

**4.** [Sign up as a tester](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.sduduzog.slimlauncher) to help access any implementations that make it to the beta channel. Your opinion is very valuable and affects **thousands** of users.

## [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoff.ee/sduduzog)
**5.** Motivation to work on this app comes from the great feedback I receive from the reviews on the Play Store and the e-mails.
That someone out there noticed the little effort that I put into it gives me all the drive I need to type away at it time and time again.

**6.** Thank you to everyone that contributed to the project and my growth as a developer.

Thank you for your time
